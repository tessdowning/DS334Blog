However, bar plots cannot show us variability and where our average lies within the data. Error bars are a great way to compare the average rating of each season because we can see that the mean rating does not represent each episode in that season. We can see the spread of the ratings.The other graphs show connection as well because we would not have been able to clean them up as well without what we’ve learned so for from this class, but the last graph does have the most elevated level of creation."

    "text": "The Dogs vs. Cats dataset was created in 2018 with data sourced from American Veterinary Medical Association via data.world and was uploaded to tidytuesday (https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2018/2018-09-11/readme.md). This dataset shows the distributions of America’s most popular house pets by State. The District og Columbia is counted as a state in this dataset. In this blog I will look at the dog and cat population per state and the percentage of dog vs cat ownership per state. Do certain states have clear preferences for a certain pet? All relevant code will reported at the end of this post.\nIt is important to note that there was no data for whether or not a household had both a dog and a cat.\nThere are 49 observations in this data set and I am interested in investigating the variables:\nstate, the location within the United States, including the District of Columbia\npercent_pet_households, the percentage of houses, per state, that own a pet\npercent_dog_owners, the percent of homes, per state, that house a dog\npercent_cat_owners, the percent of homes, per state, that house a cat\ndog_population, the total number of pet dogs per state\nand cat_population, the total number of pet cats per state\nTo showcase my observations, I will use lollipop plots and maps of the United States. The lollipop plots will be used to display the population counts of each species and the maps will be used to show the percent of households in each state that own each pet.\n\nPercentage of Pet Owners in Each State\n\n\n\n\n\nMost states have a high percentage of pet owners. The state with the most pet owners is Vermont (70.8%) and the state with the least pet owners is District of Colombia (21.9%)\n\n\nDog Population Per State\n\n\n\n\n\nTexas has the highest dog population with 7163 pups and the DOC has the lowest with 42 dogs. Texas has 5565 cats and DC has 63 cats. Based on these numbers, it does not seem as though there is a clear preference for one animal over the other\n\n\nAmerican Households with Dogs\n\n\n\n\n\nArkansas has the highest percentage of dog owners with 47.9% and the District of Columbia has the lowest with 13.1%\n\n\nCat Population Lollipop\n\n\n\n\n\nCalifornia has the highest number of cats with a total of 7118 cats. The District of Columbia has the least amount of cats with a total of 63 cats. California has 6687 dogs and the DC has 42 dogs. Based on these numbers it doesn’t seem, like there is a clear preference for a specific pet.\n\n\nCat Households\n\n\n\n\n\nVermont has the highest percentage of cat owners (49.5) and the District of Columbia has the lowest percentage of cat owners (11.6).\nThere is no direct causation to be declared from these graphs, but there are a few inferences that can be made.\nFor example, Vermont has a high amount of pet owners, especially dog owners. Vermont is a very rural state with citizens that tend to love the outdoors. It makes sense that there would be a high amount of dogs in Vermont because of an active, and outdoor lifestyle there. The DOC has a low percentage of pet owners. With DC being such a busy metropolis it would make sense that many people do not have time to take care of a pet in the way that they would like to, live in apartments, or are living in surrounding states and commuting in for work. It does not seem like many states have a clear preference in pet according to the maps. However, you can tell which states have a higher affinity for pets in general. These include Vermont, Texas, Arkansas, South Dakota, and New Mexico.\nIn the future, I would like to use a similar data set that has information about people who own both cats and dogs. I feel like it would be interesting to look at the overlap and that would definitely be more telling of whether or not certain states had a clear bias for dogs or cats. The data was flawed by the fact it was lacking this interaction.\nI chose to represent the percentage of pet, dog, and cat owners on a map because it demonstrates how where a person lives influences their behavior. I wanted to see if location had an impact on choice of pet.\n\n\nCode\n\nlibrary(maps)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(here)\nstate_df &lt;- ggplot2::map_data(\"state\")\ncats_vs_dogs &lt;- read_csv(here(\"cats_vs_dogs.csv\"))\npet_df &lt;- cats_vs_dogs |&gt; mutate(state = str_to_lower(state))\npet_full &lt;- left_join(state_df, pet_df, by = c(\"region\" = \"state\"))\n\n\nggplot(data = pet_full, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +\n  geom_polygon(colour = \"black\", aes(fill = percent_pet_households)) +\n  coord_map(projection = \"albers\", lat0 = 39, lat1 = 45) +\n  theme_void() +\n  scale_fill_distiller(type = \"seq\", direction = 1, palette = \"Greens\") +\n  labs(title = \"Percentage of Pet Owners Per State\")\npercent_df &lt;- pet_df |&gt; filter(percent_pet_households == max(percent_pet_households) |\n                     percent_pet_households == min(percent_pet_households)) |&gt;\n  select(state, percent_pet_households)\n  \npercent_df\n\n\ndog_full &lt;- pet_full |&gt;\n  mutate(Type_ordered = fct_reorder(.f = region, .x = dog_population))\n\nggplot(data = dog_full, aes(x = Type_ordered, y = dog_population)) +\n  geom_segment(aes(xend = Type_ordered, y = 0, yend = dog_population),\n               colour = \"red2\") +\n  geom_point(colour = \"red4\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(x = \"State\",\n         y = \"Dog Population\",\n       title = \"Number of Dogs in Each State\") +\n  theme_minimal() \ncount_dog &lt;- pet_df |&gt; filter(dog_population == max(dog_population) |\n                     dog_population == min(dog_population)) |&gt;\n  select(state, dog_population)\ncount_dog |&gt; tibble()\n\n\nggplot(data = pet_full, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +\n  geom_polygon(colour = \"black\", aes(fill = percent_dog_owners)) +\n  coord_map(projection = \"albers\", lat0 = 39, lat1 = 45) +\n  theme_void() +\n  scale_fill_distiller(type = \"seq\", direction = 1, palette = \"Reds\") +\n  labs(title = \"Percentage of Households that Own Dogs\",\n       fill = \"Percent of Dog Households\")\nper_dog &lt;- pet_df |&gt; filter(percent_dog_owners == max(percent_dog_owners) |\n                     percent_dog_owners == min(percent_dog_owners)) |&gt;\n  select(state, percent_dog_owners)\nper_dog |&gt; tibble()\n\n\ncat_full &lt;- pet_full |&gt;\n  mutate(Type_ordered = fct_reorder(.f = region, .x = cat_population))\nggplot(data = cat_full, aes(x = Type_ordered, y = cat_population)) +\n  geom_segment(aes(xend = Type_ordered, y = 0, yend = cat_population),\n               colour = \"cyan\") +\n  geom_point(size = 2, colour = \"navy\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(x = \"State\",\n         y = \"Cat Population\",\n       title = \"Number of Cats in Each State\") +\n  theme_minimal()\ncount_cat &lt;- pet_df |&gt; filter(cat_population == max(cat_population) |\n                     cat_population == min(cat_population)) |&gt;\n  select(state, cat_population)\ncount_cat |&gt; tibble()\n\n\nggplot(data = pet_full, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +\n  geom_polygon(colour = \"black\", aes(fill = percent_cat_owners)) +\n  coord_map(projection = \"albers\", lat0 = 39, lat1 = 45) +\n  theme_void() +\n  scale_fill_distiller(type = \"seq\", direction = 1, palette = \"Blues\") +\n  labs(title = \"Percent of Households with Pet Cats\",\n       fill = \"Percent of Cat Households\")\nper_cat &lt;- pet_df |&gt; filter(percent_cat_owners == max(percent_cat_owners) |\n                     percent_cat_owners == min(percent_cat_owners)) |&gt;\n  select(state, percent_cat_owners)\nper_cat |&gt; tibble()"
