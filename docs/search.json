    "text": "Connection to Class\nAbout a week ago , I probably would have made a bar plot for each season to compare their ratings. However, bar plots cannot show us variability and where our average lies within the data. Error bars are a great way to compare the average rating of each season because we can see that the mean rating does not represent each episode in that season. We can see the spread of the ratings.The other graphs show connection as well because we would not have been able to clean them up as well without what we’ve learned so for from this class, but the last graph does have the most elevated level of creation."
