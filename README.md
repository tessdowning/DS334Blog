This is a blog I created to learn about data visualization for my class DS334 at St. Lawrence University.

There are three posts where I explored different concepts from class using fun datasets I found using Tidy Tuesday here on GitHub!

In this project, I had the chance to work on my own and with peers.

I hope you have as much fun reading my blog as I had making it!
