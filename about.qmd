This blog was created to explore new data visualization techniques for DS334 at St. Lawrence University. The author is Tess Downing who is a senior studying Statistics and Public Health. The purpose of this blog is to hone data mapping skills while exploring fun data sets and learning how to use GitHub to access all the data a student could ever imagine.  Downing intends to use the skills from her first Quarto blog to create a blog for her Senior Year Experience focusing on Maternal Mortality During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the US. Keep an eye out for that!
